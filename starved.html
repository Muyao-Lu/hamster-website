                    <hr>
                    <p id="news-article">On this tragic day, we are gathered to commemorate the life of <span id="name"></span>, who
                        starved after the owner decided to <span id="cause"></span>. Our fellow hamster accomplished many
                        noteable acts throughout his life, including aiding in the abolishment of mandatory dust baths at the 
                        local pet store as well as playing a pivotal role in the construction of the nuclear warhead. Their 
                        <span id="attribute1"></span> and their <span id="attribute2"></span> shall not be forgotten. The Hamstapo are currently
                        investigating the cause of death, as well as bringing justice.
